## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This is my third Front end mentor challenge. The process of working with FlexBox started to feel a lot smoother.

I improved my skills with `box-shadow`. I was able to create the effect of the shadow evenly below the button.

```css
  box-shadow: 0 1.2rem 0.5rem -0.4rem hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
```


### Continued development

- Continue with Front End Mentor Challenges
- Attempt more complex challenges
- Use SASS on my next challenge
- Start to implement JavaScript

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs CSS box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This was my main resource to learn how to create the correct box-shadow effect.
